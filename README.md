# LabelMaker

This is a simple `F#` console application that uses the `GitHub` API to create a standard set of issue labels
in a repository. This makes setting up the issues for a new project easier.

See `Domain.fs` for a list of labels that will be created.

(Ironically, I did not create these labels for this repo, as I don't see it being much more than a one-off.)
